# solitaire-game-python
Python implementation of a solitaire-style card game
This project implements the core game logic of a solitaire-style card game as part of my university coursework.
It includes:

Initialization of the game state

Parsing user input

Move validation based on game rules

Updating stacks and game state

Handling blocked columns

Detecting win conditions

Implementing reset and undo

This project helped me practice Python data structures, state management, and rule-based logic design.
